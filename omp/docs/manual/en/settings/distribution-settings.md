### <a name="copyright-v-license"></a> What's the difference between Copyright and a License?

The copyright identifies the author or owner of copyright for a published work. For example, Copyright (c) 2016 by Jane Smith.

The license attached to a work will determine the usage rights for the published work. For example, CC-By 4.0 allows the work to be copied, redistributed and adapted for any purpose, even commercially, as long as attribution is given to the copyright holder.
