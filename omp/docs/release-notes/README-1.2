OMP 1.2 Release Notes
CVS tag: omp-1_2_0-0
Release date: April 11, 2016
=================================

As this is a major release, we recommend performing a test upgrade and
reviewing the system before upgrading in production. There are numerous
workflow, setup, and layout changes.

Configuration Changes
---------------------

The Press Name setting, inside the Appearance tab under Settings -> Website
page is removed. 
The system now is using only one Press name, and it can be defined at
Masthead tab, under Settings -> Website page. Please, check if your press name
is displayed as you expect at the top left of your site (if you are using a logo, 
the name will not appear). If it's not the name you wanted to show, change the
Masthead press name setting.
